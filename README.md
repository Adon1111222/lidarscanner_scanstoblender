# Lidar Scanner 2 Scans To Blender
Python script file for Blender. Imports dots from Lidar Scanner's scan files. Very slow. If you know how to fix it - tell me.
## Usage
Go to the Scripting tab in Blender and select this script by clicking on the button with the folder icon. Configure the script and click on the run icon. 
Wait a couple of minutes. Now you should see dots(if you do not see them in the viewport, they should appear in the project explorer, either the file is empty or a reading error occurred)

### Ð¡onfiguration
There is no menu yet and you have to do everything through a text editor(you can use the text editor in Blender).
All strings must be closed with quotes.
